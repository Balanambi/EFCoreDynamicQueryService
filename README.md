# EFCoreDynamicQueryService
Generic Dynamic Query Service for EF Core with Type Conversion
Key Features:

Database-Level Type Conversion: Uses EF.Functions.Convert() to perform type conversion at the database level, not in memory
Generic and Reusable: Works with any entity type and property
Dynamic Property Access: Supports nested properties and complex filtering
Multiple Filter Support: Can combine multiple filters with different operations
Extension Methods: Provides fluent API for easier usage

Main Components:
1. DynamicQueryService

Handles building dynamic LINQ expressions
Performs type conversion using database functions
Supports various comparison operations

2. FilterCriteria Class

Defines filter parameters including target type for conversion
Supports different operations (Equal, Contains, etc.)

3. Extension Methods

Provides fluent API for easier usage
Integrates seamlessly with existing LINQ queries

Usage Examples:
csharp// Simple usage - convert int to string for comparison
var results = await context.MyEntities
    .WhereDynamic("IntColumn", "123", FilterOperation.Equal)
    .ToListAsync();

// Multiple filters with type conversion
var filters = new List<FilterCriteria>
{
    new FilterCriteria 
    { 
        PropertyName = "IntColumn", 
        Value = "123", 
        Operation = FilterOperation.Equal,
        TargetType = typeof(string)
    }
};

var query = context.MyEntities.WhereMultiple(filters);
Key Benefits:

No In-Memory Processing: All operations happen at the database level
Type Safety: Handles type mismatches gracefully
Performance: Generates efficient SQL queries
Reusable: Works across all your tables with similar issues
Extensible: Easy to add new conversion types and operations

The service automatically detects when type conversion is needed and uses the appropriate database function (EF.Functions.Convert) to handle the conversion in SQL, ensuring your large datasets remain in the database throughout the filtering process.
